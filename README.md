# Project Title: Text Processing with Transformers

## Description

This project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and summarization. The project demonstrates the capabilities of pre-trained models and pipelines for efficient text processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- `transformers` version 4.46.3
- `tf-keras` version 2.17.0
- `datasets` version 3.1.0

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install tf-keras
pip install datasets
```

## Usage

### Text Generation

To generate text using a pre-trained model:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='openai-community/gpt2')
output = generator("today is monday", truncation=True, num_return_sequences=2)
print(output)
```

### Sentiment Analysis

To analyze the sentiment of a given text:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
result = classifier('I hate this car')
print(result)
```

### Question Answering

To answer questions based on a given context:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")
result = qa_pipeline(
    question="Where do I work?",
    context="My name is Rajesh and I work as a fresher."
)
print(result)
```

### Summarization

To summarize a long piece of text:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("summarization")
summary = classifier("Paris is the capital and most populous city of France...")
print(summary)
```

## Dataset Loading

To load datasets for training or evaluation:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers")
print(dataset)
```
